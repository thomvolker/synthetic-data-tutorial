# Licenses

The overall project is available under the **[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)** license found at [LICENSE](LICENSE.md); all code without any narrative text is also (at your option) available under the **[CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)** license found at [LICENSE-CODE](LICENSE-CODE.md).

Why two licenses? The CC BY-SA 4.0 license is for the content of the website, while the CC0 1.0 Universal license is for the code and configuration files. This is a common practice for websites that include code snippets and other content that may be reused in other projects, particularly because the CC BY-SA 4.0 license is not intended to be used with software.
