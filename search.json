    "section": "Divergence estimation through density ratio estimation",
    "text": "Divergence estimation through density ratio estimation\nOne way to evaluate global utility is by comparing the distributions of the observed and synthetic data directly. This can be done using density ratio estimation, which, like the name suggests, attempts to estimate the ratio of the densities of two groups of samples (note that we mean the same thing with distribution and density, although some nuances exist). That is, we attempt to estimate \\[\nr(X) = \\frac{f_\\text{obs}(X)}{f_\\text{syn}(X)}.\n\\] This can be done by estimating the distributions of \\(f_\\text{obs}(X)\\) and \\(f_\\text{syn}(X)\\), but estimating \\(r(X)\\) directly typically yields better results. The R-package densityratio has been developed for this purpose (Volker, Gonzalez Poses, and van Kesteren 2024). Based on the density ratio, we can estimate various divergence measures between the two data sets, which is an in-built functionality.\n\n7. Compare the observed and synthetic data with the ulsif() function from the densityratio package. Do this for both synthetic data sets.\nNote: Set numerator_data = data and denominator_data = syn_passive$syn first, and denominator_data = syn_cart$syn second.\n\n\n\nShow code: Estimate density ratio with ulsif()\nr_passive &lt;- ulsif(data, syn_passive$syn)\nr_cart &lt;- ulsif(data, syn_cart$syn)\n\n\nThe ulsif() function performs cross-validation to find the optimal model to estimate the density ratio, so that typically no model specification on behalf of the user is required.\n\n8. Call plot() on the estimated model objects. This displays the distributions of the estimated density ratio values for the observed and synthetic data.\nHint: The more these distributions overlap, the higher the similarity between the observed and synthetic data.\n\n\n\nShow code: Plot density ratio values\nplot(r_passive)\nplot(r_cart)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipShow output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Negative estimated density ratios for 108 observation(s) converted to\n0.01 before applying logarithmic transformation\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Synthetic data is generated data that can be used as an alternative to privacy-sensitive data, for example to enhance open science practices. Advantages of open (synthetic) data are numerous: other researchers can re-run analyses with data that is close to the actual data, which allows them to verify the main results. Additionally, open (synthetic) data allows researchers to perform exploratory analyses that may lead to novel hypotheses, and in quite some instances performing such analyses with synthetic data yields rather accurate results. Moreover, realistic synthetic can be used in teaching, or for starting with model building when access to the real data is currently still prohibited.

    "text": "Introduction\nCollected research data often contains sensitive information about individuals. For example, social scientists might collect data on income or criminal behavior, and health data often contains medical information of individuals. Such private information may harm the people involved if disclosed to the public. Even if no harm is incurred, the trust of individuals in the data collector, or scientific institutions in general, may be damaged if such data is revealed. At the same time, broad data availability is very valuable to researchers and governmental institutions alike. Using previously collected data, researchers may answer novel research questions and governmental institutions may improve policy. In addition to these high-level applications, open data can also be used to evaluate the reproducibility of research projects or serve as realistic data in education. That is, open data is valuable for many applications, but simply releasing the data is often not an option.\nThe first step in the process of releasing data is to anonymize it [TODO: see Data Anonymization tutorial]. Anonymization requires that potentially identifying information is removed from the collected data. Examples of such identifying information are names, addresses, IP-addresses, that can often be removed without losing important information. However, after de-identifying the data, your data might still contain information that can lead to indirect identification of individuals, for example because the data can be linked to external data sources. Especially in today’s age of massive data collection, data sources can be linked in surprising ways. In 2006, University of Texas researchers reidentified Netflix users by linking their reviews to IMDb data. While likely harmless for most, it exposed sensitive details, such as sexual orientation, leading to potential privacy risks.\n\n\nStatistical disclosure control\nThe term “Statistical disclosure control” refers to a suite of statistical methods that aim to protect collected data such that they can be safely released to the public without disclosing confidential information about these individuals. The goal of statistical disclosure control is to release a data set that is as similar as possible to the original data, while at the same time ensuring that no individual can be identified from the released data, nor any sensitive information can be inferred (Hundepool et al. 2024). Disclosure is here defined as the release of information about an individual that would not have become public if the data would be kept private. Two types of disclosure risk are commonly considered:\n\nRe-identification disclosure occurs when individuals can be singled out from the released data, resulting in confidential data being leaked.\nAttribute disclosure refers to situations in which characteristics of individuals can be learned with (near) certainty from the data release. For example, if a release discloses that all inhabitants of a street in some city are on welfare, knowing that a person lives in this street discloses information on their welfare status.\n\nEvery data release requires that both re-identification disclosure and attribute disclosure risks are sufficiently small.\nAt the same time, the goal of a data release is to allow others to do something useful with the released data, and for this purpose, the released data should be similar to the original data. Similarity, in this context, means that the released, but protected, data can be used for the same purposes as the original data. To a reasonable degree, analyses on the released data should yield results similar to results obtained from the original data. Similarity does not mean that the released records are similar to the original records, but rather that over the whole, the distributions of the observed and released data are similar. Statistical disclosure control often yields a trade-off between privacy and utility: the stricter the data protection, the better the privacy of respondents is protected, but the more information is lost, and the lower the utility of the data.\nThe level of protection required depends on the data at hand: data from an insensitive experiment with only very general personal information may require very little protection, while an extensive survey on criminal behavior or sensitive issues should typically be well-protected. At the same time, the level of utility required depends on the problem at hand: if the released data should allow to replicate complex analyses to a reasonable degree of accuracy, more sophisticated disclosure methods are required than when solely some marginal quantities (e.g., means and standard deviations) should be preserved. Note that the privacy-utility trade-off is very much relative: a released data set can be very useful for some purposes, but almost useless for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The privacy-utility trade-off: one can typically attain either high privacy or high utility, but not both at the same time. Typically, there can be substantial utility of the synthetic data, but some privacy risk will remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConventional statistical disclosure control methods\nIn practice, many techniques for statistical disclosure control have been developped over the year for microdata; that is, data on individual observations, potentially measured at multiple locations, in contrast to tables with aggregated data. Typically, these techniques limit the amount of information that is released, thereby introducing statistical bias and variance (Fienberg and Slavković 2011). For example, one might set a threshold to variables such that extreme values are not released, which typically creates bias in the distribution of the released values. As an other example, adding noise to observed values will increase the variance of the released data relative to the observed data. Common methods that have traditionally been used for statistical disclosure control are (e.g., Reiter 2011; Hundepool et al. 2024):\n\nAggregation: collapsing categories into larger overarching categories (e.g., towns into municipalities or regions, divisions into companies).\nRounding: replacing original values with their rounded counterpart (e.g., income in thousands of euros, age in years).\nTop coding: cap all values higher or lower than some threshold to this threshold (sometimes, only relatively extreme values, such as very large income values, yield a high risk of disclosure).\nMicroaggregation: combine observations into groups of some size where people within a group are maximally similar, calculate the group mean for each variable used to form groups, and replace values on these variables by the respective group mean.\nSuppression: remove sensitive or identifying values from the released data directly (this can even be an entire variable).\nAdding noise: random noise is added to the observed values, such that the released value is different from the underlying observed value.\n\nEach of these methods methods either introduce errors in the data, such that the released information cannot be inferred to be entirely accurate, or limits the amount of information that is released in such a way that disclosure risks are small. However, an important limitation of these methods is that relationships between variables are usually not accounted for. While it is possible for some of these approaches to be applied on a multivariate level, this is often not easy and typically not done in practice. Thus, when relationships between variables are of interest, for example when the released data should allow to reproduce regression analyses on the observed data, these traditional methods might distort the data too much. Synthetic data might provide a better solution, as instead of distorting the data, it attempts to model the multivariate distribution of the data, and thus allows to capture relationships between variables. The idea of synthetic data will be more thoroughly explained in the subsequent section.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nFienberg, Stephen E., and Aleksandra B.

    "text": "Now that we understand the concept of synthetic data and know about the dangers and potential, it is time to actually generate synthetic data in R. Throughout, we will use the synthpop package (Nowok, Raab, and Dibben 2016), which is a powerful tool explicitly designed to generate synthetic data. Other alternatives to create synthetic data are, for example, the R-package mice (van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011; Volker and Vink 2021) or the stand-alone software IVEware (Raghunathan, Solenberger, and Van Hoewyk 2002). Additionally, we will use the package densityratio (Volker, Gonzalez Poses, and van Kesteren 2024) to evaluate the utility of synthetic data.\nMake sure to load all of the required packages, and in case you haven’t installed them already, install them first, using install.packages(\"package_name\").\n\n1. Load the R-packages synthpop and densityratio using library().\n\n\nShow code: Loading required packages\nlibrary(synthpop)\nlibrary(densityratio)\n\n\n\n\nData\n\nThroughout the practical, we will continue with the boys data from the mice package that we also used in the previous section. Note that you cannot simply load the data from the mice package, because the missing values are imputed to simplify the practical. You can download the data as follows:\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(\n    url(\"https://github.com/lmu-osc/synthetic-data-tutorial/raw/refs/heads/main/data/boys.RDS\")\n)\n\nThe boys data contains measurements on 9 variables on 748 Dutch boys. The variables in the data are described in the block below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDescription of the boys data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage: Decimal age (0-21 years)\nhgt: Height (cm)\nwgt: Weight (kg)\nbmi: Body mass index\nhc: Head circumference (cm)\ngen: Genital Tanner stage (G1-G5)\nphb: Pubic hair (Tanner P1-P6)\ntv: Testicular volume (ml)\nreg: Region (north, east, west, south, city)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting to know the data\n\nNormally, this step would be redundant, as you probably analyzed the data of interest already and know all the ins and outs. However, if the boys data is new for you, it is helpful to invest some time in getting to know the data you will be working with. When creating synthetic data, it eases the modelling procedure when you know what variables there are in the data, and which kinds of relationships you can expect.\n\n2. Inspect the first few rows of the data using head().\n\n\n\nShow code: Inspect first few rows\nhead(data)\n\n\n\n3. Use the summary() function to get an overview of the data.\n\n\n\nShow code: Inspect first few rows\nsummary(data)\n\n\nYou may notice a couple of things. First, the data seems to be sorted by age. You may verify this by running !is.unsorted(data$age). Second, you may notice that most variables are non-negative, which might be something you want to take into account when modelling the data (but perhaps, this is not so relevant for the analysis at hand; for now, we assume it is). Third, you may notice that the variable bmi is mathematically linked to the variables hgt and wgt. We want to take this into account when modelling the data. Finally, note that the data consist of a mix of continuous and categorical variables.\n\n\n\nCreating synthetic data\n\nThroughout the tutorial, we create data using fully conditional specification, which is implemented in the synthpop package. The most important function in the package is syn(). The syn() function takes a dataset, estimates a set of conditional models, and draws synthetic data from these models. The other arguments allow to specify various modelling choices, for example which model to use for which variable, which set of predictor variables to use for modelling each synthetic variable, whether there are particular constraints that need to be taken into account, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipModelling choices in synthpop\n\n\n\nSome of the most important arguments of the syn() function are the following (you can use ?synthpop::syn() for a more exaustive list). The syn() function will take these modelling choices into account when modelling each synthetic variable, and the resulting synthetic data, called syn in the output list, adheres to these specifications.\n\nmethod\nEither a single character string with a synthesis model that is applied to all variables, or a character vector with a synthesis model per variable. The default method is use classification and regression trees (cart) for all variables, which is a flexible, non-parametric technique for modelling synthetic data (for an introduction on classification and regression trees, see, for instance, Section 8.1 in James et al. 2023). Other synthesis models that are available are listed below (for a more thorough explanation, see ?synthpop::syn.METHOD, with METHOD replaced by the actual method as specified below).\nMethods for continuous variables\n\nbag: bagging.\ncart: classification and regression trees.\nnorm: linear regression.\nsqrtnorm: linear regression on the square root of the outcome variable.\ncubertnorm: linear regression on the cubic root of the outcome variable.\nlognorm: linear regression on the natural logarithm of the outcome.variable.\nnormrank: linear regression on normal quantiles of the ranks of the outcome, new values are drawn by matching synthetic ranks with observed ranks, and drawing synthetic values corresponding to the observed ranks.\npmm: predictive mean matching.\nranger: random forests using the ranger package.\nrf: random forests using the randomForest package.\nsample: random sampling with replacement from the observed data.\n\nMethods for categorical data\n\nsatcat: Generates a variable from all possible combination of its predictors using sampling (so only combinations with observed values can be synthesized).\ncatall: Extends satcat, by drawing generating all categorical variables simultaneously from a multinomial distribution. This allows to generate synthetic values for combinations of cells that are not in the observed data, and to specify structural zeros (i.e., combinations of cells that are impossible). The multinomial model is actually a joint model for the categorical variables. The continuous variables can then be modelled using the fully conditional specification approach (this only works when first using joint modelling, and then modelling the remainder using fully conditional specification).\nipf: Iterative proportional fitting with additional noise to yield better privacy guarantees (satisfies differential privacy, for a non-technical introduction on this, see Desfontaines 2023).\nlogreg: logistic regression.\npolr: ordered polytomous regression (logistic regression with an outcome with \\(&gt; 2\\) categories).\npolyreg: unordered polytomous regression.\nnested: synthesizes a variable that is nested in the categories of another variable.\ncart pmm, ranger, rf and sample are all also available for categorical variables.\n\nMethods for survival data\n\nsurvctree: generates synthetic survival data using classification and regression trees.\n\n\n\ndefault.method\nA string of length four with a user-specified default method for (1) continuous variables, (2) categorical variables with 2 levels, (3) ordered categorical variables with more than 2 levels, and (4) unordered categorical variables with more than 2 levels. Note that this default.method is only used when method = \"parametric\", or when there is a mismatch between the synthesis method and the variable type.\n\n\nvisit.sequence\nDetermines the order in which the variables are synthesized. While in theory this order is not supposed to matter much, in practice it can make a difference in some cases. Raab, Nowok, and Dibben (2017) state that if there exist a subset of variables which relationships are most important, it is often beneficial to synthesize these first. Variables with many categories are typically hard to synthesize, and may yield an unfeasible number of parameters for models of later synthesized variables, so you might consider synthesizing these at the final stages.\n\n\npredictor.matrix\nYou might want to exclude some variables as predictor for subsequent variables. This can be helpful if you know there are no relationships between some of the variables, or if you want to include an ID variable in the synthetic data, but not use this as a predictor of subsequent variables.\n\n\nk\nThe number of synthetic records that will be generated. You can generate more or less observations than in the observed data, but note that the information in the synthetic samples cannot exceed the information in the observed data.\n\n\nrules and rvalues\nThe rules argument expects a named list that contains rules for restricted values. These restricted values are determined by values of other variables: for example, monthly income should be zero for children who are too young to have a paid job (in the Netherlands, the age limit is 12 years). The rvalues argument expects a named list, but with the values to attach to those observations who adhere to the rules specified in rules. So, if you want to specify that every boy with genital tanner stage “G1” has pubic hair tanner stage “P1”, you can set\nrules = list(phb = \"gen == 'G1'\")\nrvalues = list(phb = 1)\n\n\nsemicont\nSome variables might have a point mass for some values. For example, income variables often have a spike at 0 for people who don’t have a paid job. This point mass can be modelled separately by first predicting whether an observation has either a zero or non-zero value, and subsequently modelling the income values for those observations with a non-zero value.\n\n\nsmoothing\nSome imputation methods for continuous variables sample the synthetic values from the observed variable. Since re-using observed values may worsen privacy risks, smoothing can be applied such that there is additional randomness in the values that end up in the synthetic data. The smoothing argument expects a character string with the smoothing method per variable.\n\n\n\nWe will first create synthetic data with a relatively simple, parametric, synthesis model. To this end, we need to decide on a parametric model to synthesize each variable, which can be done by specifying method = \"parametric\" in the call to syn(). This implies that continuous variables are synthesized using a linear model that preserves the marginal distribution even in the case of non-normality. Specifically, normrank first transforms the observed data to standard normal quantiles based on the relative ranks of the values. Subsequently, a linear regression model is fitted on these quantiles using all predictors that were synthesized previously. Finally, synthetic values are drawn from the observed data by backtransforming the synthetic quantiles to ranks, and matching the ranks with the observed data. Categorical variables with two categories are synthesized with a logistic regression model and categorical variables with more than two categories are synthesized using ordered or unordered polytomous regression (which is an extension to logistic regression for more than two categories), depending on whether the categories are ordered or not, respectively.\n\n4. Use synthpop() to create a synthetic data set in an object called syn_param using method = \"parametric\". Use seed = 123 if you want to replicate our results.\n\n\n\nShow code: Generating synthetic data with parametric models\nsyn_param &lt;- syn(\n    data = data,\n    method = \"parametric\",\n    seed = 123,\n    print.flag = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n5. Inspect the syn_param object, what do you see?\n\n\n\nShow code and context of the model object\nsyn_param\n\n# Calling syn_param shows you some important features of the synthesis \n# procedure. First, it shows the number of synthetic data sets that were \n# generated (syn_param$m). Also, it shows for every variable the method \n# that was used to synthesize the data (syn_param$method). If you want to \n# know more about a specific synthesis method, for example, logreg, you \n# can call ?syn.logreg to get more information.\n\n\nIf all is well, all continuous variables are strictly positive, which is due to matching the synthetic ranks with observed ranks and sampling the corresponding values from this (as explained above). However, there is a problem that you might have noticed. The variable bmi is not equal to wgt / (hgt/100)^2. This issue can be fixed using passive synthesis, which will be demonstrated in the next section\n\n\n\nSpecifying custom synthesis models\n\nIn synthpop, the synthesis method can be altered using the method argument. The method-vector is a vector that contains, for every variable, the imputation method or passive imputation equation with which this variable should be imputed. We can obtain the method-vector that we previously specified implicitly by extracting it from the syn_param object.\n\nmethod &lt;- syn_param$method\nmethod\n\n       age        hgt        wgt        bmi         hc        gen        phb \n  \"sample\" \"normrank\" \"normrank\" \"normrank\" \"normrank\"     \"polr\"     \"polr\" \n        tv        reg \n\"normrank\"  \"polyreg\" \n\n\nWe can alter the synthesis model for any variable by changing the corresponding element in this vector. For passive imputation, we can define a function using ~I(equation). For bmi, this entails the following.\n\nmethod[\"bmi\"] &lt;- \"~I(wgt/(hgt/100)^2)\"\nmethod\n\n                  age                   hgt                   wgt \n             \"sample\"            \"normrank\"            \"normrank\" \n                  bmi                    hc                   gen \n\"~I(wgt/(hgt/100)^2)\"            \"normrank\"                \"polr\" \n                  phb                    tv                   reg \n               \"polr\"            \"normrank\"             \"polyreg\" \n\n\nWith this specification, synthpop knows that it should not use an imputation model, but rather use the synthetic hgt and wgt values to construct the bmi values deterministically.\n\n6. Use synthpop() to create a synthetic data set in an object called syn_passive using the adjusted method vector. Again, use seed = 123 if you want to replicate our results. Inspect the output.\n\n\n\nShow code: Synthesize with passive synthesis\nsyn_passive &lt;- syn(\n    data = data,\n    method = method,\n    seed = 123,\n    print = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\nVariable(s) bmi with passive synthesis: relationship does not hold in data.\nTotal of 723 case(s) where predictors do not give value present in data.\nYou might want to recompute the variable(s) in the original data.\n\n\nThe printed message signals that synthpop detects that the specified relationship does not hold in the real data. This is not really something to worry about: it is due to rounding errors in bmi.\n\n\nShow code: Passive model object\nsyn_passive\n\n\nThe bmi values correspond to the synthetic hgt and wgt values, as we wanted. Using this approach, you can also specify different synthesis methods in general, for example to synthesize some of the variables with a random forest model, or to transform some of the variables before synthesizing them. There are too many possibilities to cover in this practical, but the synthpop package contains extensive documentation (see, for instance, ?synthpop::syn and vignette(\"synthpop\", \"synthpop\")).\n\n\nAdvanced: Extensions to synthpop\nSynthpop comes with an extensive suite of functionality for generating synthetic data, that already allow for a wide range of applications. It can, however, occur that you want models that are not yet incorporated. In synthpop, it is possible to write custom synthesis functions that extend the existing suite of methods. Leaving the nitty-gritty aside, we can write a synthesis function that starts with syn. and then some name, that takes arguments y (the observed variable to be synthesized), x (the predictors in the observed data), xp (the previously synthesized predictor variables) and additional parameters for the model at hand (in our case, there aren’t any). Then, we need to fit the model on the observed data, x and y, and from this model draw new observations from the synthetic predictors, xp. This is illustrated below with a regression model, where all synthetic values lie exactly on the regression line (this is a very stupid idea, but it allows to display the procedure in a straightforward manner). The output of the synthetic data function should be a list with arguments res, the synthetic data values, and fit, the parameters of the fitted model. Note here that you don’t accidentally leak the observed data!\n\nsyn.synthesis_function &lt;- function(y, x, xp, ...) {\n    new_y &lt;- as.matrix(y)             # variable to be synthesized\n    new_x &lt;- as.matrix(x)             # observed predictor variables\n    new_xp &lt;- cbind(1, as.matrix(xp)) # previously synthesized variables\n    fit &lt;- lm(new_y~new_x)            # fitted model\n    return(\n        list(\n            res = new_xp %*% coef(fit), # synthetic values\n            fit = coef(fit)\n        )\n    )\n}\n\nmethod[\"hgt\"] &lt;- \"synthesis_function\"\n\nsyn_method_spec &lt;- syn(\n    data = data,\n    method = method,\n    seed = 123,\n    print = FALSE\n)$syn\n\n\nVariable(s) bmi with passive synthesis: relationship does not hold in data.\nTotal of 723 case(s) where predictors do not give value present in data.\nYou might want to recompute the variable(s) in the original data.\n\nplot(syn_method_spec$age, syn_method_spec$hgt)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this procedure, you can combine modelling functions that are self-written or stem from alternative packages with the synthesis procedure in synthpop. This also allows to model, for example, a hierarchical structure, using the R-package lme4 (lme4?), glmmTMB (glmmTMB?) or, if you prefer a Bayesian procedure, with brms (brms?). In such instances, one can incorporate the hierarchical structure replacing the single level models with their hierarchical counterparts from these packages. Since no one has done this for synthetic data yet, relevant resources do not seem to exist, but feel free to reach out if you plan on doing this. To read more about modelling hierarchical data in the context of imputation for missing data, see Yucel et al. (2017); Speidel, Drechsler, and Jolani (2020)].\n\n\nConclusion\nThe exercises here showed that synthpop allows quite some flexibility when modelling synthetic data, and simplifies the process substantially. However, further refinements might sometimes be possible. In the subsequent section, we will discuss how to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data at hand, from both a privacy and utility perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nDesfontaines, Damien. 2023. “A Friendly, Non-Technical Introduction to Differential Privacy.” https://desfontain.es/blog/friendly-intro-to-differential-privacy.html.\n\n\nJames, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2023.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The idea of synthetic data has first been proposed independently in 1993 by Donald B. Rubin and Roderick J.A. Little, who are known as members of the founding fathers of modern missing data theory (Rubin 1993; Little 1993). Both proposed, albeit in slightly different ways, to not release the original data, but replace values from the original data with values drawn from some model. That is, synthetic data is nothing more than generated data, and is occasionally called simulated data, digital twins or even fake data. This model can be specified independent of the data at hand, but typically it is estimated on a data set. Moreover, the model can range from very simple (e.g., a set of values with attached probabilities) to extremely complex (e.g., a neural network with billions of parameters). Whatever model is used, it is essential that new samples can be generated from it. These newly drawn samples can then be released to the public, as a surrogate dataset that mimics the original data statistically.\nIn what follows, we assume that there is a observed data set, \\(X\\), consisting of \\(n\\) observations measured on \\(p\\) variables. Furthermore, we assume that these observations adhere to some structure that we can encode in the joint distribution of the variables, \\(f(X)\\). If we would know this distribution, we could sample new observations from it directly, but we typically do not know this. However, we can estimate this joint distribution, leading to \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\), and sample new observations from this.",

    "section": "Joint modelling",
    "text": "Joint modelling\nOne approach to modelling synthetic data, is by estimating the multivariate distribution of the data directly, and use this single joint model to draw values for all variables simultaneously. We can, for example, model the distribution of the data using a normal approximation. That is, we estimate the means and covariances of the variables in the data, assume normality, and generate synthetic samples from this normal distribution. For many data sets, however, this normal approximation provides a poor fit.\nIn the past decade, deep learning has become popular for the generation of synthetic data. An advantage of these methods, in particular generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs), is that they do not assume a particular parametric distribution (like the normal approximation we just discussed). Rather, these methods attempt to learn the distribution of the data, by transforming relatively simple input data in a way that resembles the observed data. While these methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance, extensive tuning is often required to achieve this performance. Moreover, tuning these models such that they produce realistic synthetic data is non-trivial and often performed in an ad hoc fashion, subsantially lowering user-friendliness.",

    "section": "Fully conditional specification",
    "text": "Fully conditional specification\nA second strategy is to break the joint distribution of the data into a series of conditional distributions, one for each variable (or a block of variables). That is, we can factor the joint distribution of the data into a series of conditionals \\[\nf(X) = f_1(X_1) f_2(X_2|X_1) \\dots f_p(X_p|X_1, \\dots X_{p-1}),\n\\] which greatly simplifies the modelling task. That is, rather than specifying the joint distribution, we can model the distribution of each variable separately, somewhat akin to specifying a good prediction model, but with the addition of reasonable assumptions for the noise. In practice, we might proceed as follows.\n\nStarting from the first variable, we specify a distribution that provides a reasonable approximation to the distribution of the data at hand.\nFor the second variable, we specify a prediction model that predicts this variable on the basis of the first, and combine this model with a distribution for the residual variance. If we would use, for example, a linear regression model with normally distributed errors, we fit a regression model with the first variable as predictor and the second variable as outcome. This model is used to predict the second variable from the first in the synthetic data, after which the variance is added by drawing random errors from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance equal to the residual variance of the fitted model.\nFor the third variable, we can use a prediction model based on the first two variables, and so on, until all variables are synthesized.\n\nNote that, although in theory the order of synthesis should not matter much, in practice it may make a difference in some cases. We will come back to this issue and provide some concrete advice in the next section.\nFully conditional specification has two distinct advantages over joint modelling: 1. It allows great flexibility, because a different model can be used for each variable. That is, this linear model can be combined with or replaced by non-linear (e.g., non-parametric) models that capture non-linear relationships (or non-normal error terms). 2. Traditional model evaluation techniques, such as regression diagnostics and posterior predictive checks can be used directly (see the relevant vignette from the performance package for a practical introduction), and potential improvements can be readily incorporated into the synthesis model.1 For example, if a model with a linear relationship between two variables yields a poor fit, a non-linear relationship can be easily incorporated in the synthesis model.\nIn what follows, we focus on synthesis methods that employ this conditional modelling strategy (commonly called fully conditional specification or sequential regression).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAdditional resources\n\n\n\nThere is, of course, much more to say about specifying synthesis models that we cannot cover all in these materials. However, if you wish to learn more about specifying joint models for creating synthetic data, you might find the following resources helpful.\n\nMurray (2018) (section 6.1): Focuses on specifying joint models for multiple imputation of missing data, but the idea transfers directly to generation of synthetic data (that is, we assume that the missing data occurs in \\(n_{syn}\\) new samples that are fully missing, or we overimpute the observed data).\nChollet, Kalinowski, and Allaire (2022) (chapter 12): On deep learning for the generation of synthetic data.\nVolker (2025): Easy and primarily illustrative introduction on generating (simple) synthetic data based on GANs in R.\n\nIf you are interested in any additional resources on fully conditional specification, the following papers might be informative.\n\nBuuren et al. (2006): explains the procedure in the context of missing data. Again, adapting the framework to synthetic data is straightforward.\nDrechsler (2011) (section 3.1.2) discusses the concept of fully conditional specification (and compares it to joint modelling in the subsequent section).",

While in this specific example, the outcomes were essentially the same, this is not generally the case. That is, the combination of three conditional normal models with solely main effects is equivalent to a tri-variate normal distribution, but using fully conditional specification you can specify any model that you deem appropriate, even if this does not give rise to a well-defined multivariate probability distribution. As stated in Section 2, we can model a subset of the variables, or the entire data set using non-parametric models, and a different model can be specified for each variable. Because of this flexibility, and it’s presence in existing software, we will use the fully conditional specification strategy throughout. Before we get there, we discuss some additional considerations for generating synthetic data.",
